        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>skimmed milk</li>
            <li>maida</li>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>rava</li>
            <li>baking soda</li>
            <li>Cardamom</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take khoya (mawa or evaporated milk) in a bowl. Mash it very well. 
                There should be no lumps. 
                You can also grate and then mash the khoya.
            </li>

            <li>Then add grated paneer, rava (sooji), all purpose flour (maida), baking powder and cardamom powder to the mashed khoya. 
                There should be no lumps in both the mawa and paneer.
            </li>

            <li>As if they are there, then you will find the texture of the gulab jamun not so good.
                 The bits and pieces of mava or paneer will give a bite in the mouth, when you have the gulab jamun. 
                They won’t be smooth.
            </li>

            <li>
                Mix well. Add milk and gather together to form a dough with milk. Don’t knead.
            </li>

            <li>
                Just gently mix. If you are unable to form balls or if the mixture appears dry, then add a few teaspoons of milk. 
                Cover the dough and keep aside for 30 mins.
            </li>

            <li>
                Make small balls from the dough. Cover the balls and keep aside.
            </li>

        </ol>
        <br>
        <h4>Making Sugar Syrup</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Dissolve sugar in water. Heat the sugar solution till it become sticky. 
                You just need to switch off the fire before the syrup reaches a one thread consistency.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add rose water and stir. Keep the sugar solution aside. 
                On cooling if the sugar syrup crystallizes, then just add 2 to 3 tbsp water and warm the syrup again. 
                It will again return to a liquid state.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h4>Frying</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, while the sugar syrup is cooking, heat oil till its medium hot. 
                Lower the flame and wait for a minute. 
                Then gently place the dough balls in the oil.
            </li>

            <li>
                Once they start to have tiny golden spots, keep on rotating them in the oil, so that the jamun are evenly browned.
            </li>

            <li>
                Remove the fried jamun and then drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h4>Making Gulab Jamun</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Then place the hot fried dough balls in the sugar syrup. 
                Continue frying the rest of the dough balls in batches.
            </li>

            <li>
                When all the jamuns are placed in the sugar syrup, then keep the whole pan with the sugar syrup and the gulab jamun, on a low flame for 1 to 2 minutes till the jamun become soft.
            </li>

            <li>
                Heating helps the gulab jamun to absorb the syrup and become soft. The jamun increase a bit in size. 
                Don’t overcook as then the jamun can break.
            </li>

            <li>
                Use a large pan, so that the jamuns are not overcrowded and you can easily stir them gently while they are simmering.
            </li>

            <li>
                Serve gulab jamun warm or at room temperature. 
                You can also chill them and serve them cold. 
                Garnish with rose petals or almond slivers.
            </li>
        </ol>
